Hi there  
My name is Farhad. I'm a software developer. Let's keep it short. I have some experience in:  
  
 * Backend development (Most of the time, this is my job title)
 * Publish and maintenance automation scripts and configurations (Fun, except that one time that I dropped the database. Not fun.)
 * Designing and configuring network and security infrastructure of our own distributed software on private servers  
 * Splitting monolith app into multiple independant set of services to load balance and increase HA

From the begining of this year (2021) I'm discovering `Serverless` and `AWS Lambda functions` while implementing a software in Fintech field (No it's not `yet another promising crypto exchange`). I'm developing this fully serverless app with `Go`.  

In this blog, I will share my latest thoughts and discoveries about my challenges, workarounds, decisions, trade-offs, and resolved problems in this project.
