> Hi there  
> My name is Farhad. I'm a software developer. Let's keep it short. I have some experience in:
>  
> * Backend development (Most of the time, this is my job title)
> * Publish and maintenance automation scripts and configurations (Fun, except that one time that I dropped the database. Not fun.)
> * Designing and configuring network and security infrastructure of our own distributed software on private servers (Painful, and fun. I mean, have you ever blocked your own access on a firewall in another city, at night?! and had a car crash on 3 AM because of a sleepy driver? I didn't tell it to anyone at that time. But don't assume that it was all fun. I was going to die for a single line of iptables rule. Really. That was not fun. There were also fun stories. BTW, I was going to keep it short, so let's move on)
> * Android development (Also modifying android source to make a full kiosk device and prevent any form of exit from the main application (I just modified the init.rc file and also appended some bash scripts in android root dir to prevent some methods of jail breaking. I didn't touch those scary c++ files - except that one arrow function in one of them))
> * Keeping explanations short, as you may have noticed already.

From the begining of this year (2021) I'm discovering `Serverless` and `AWS Lambda functions` while implementing a software in Fintech field (No it's not `yet another promising crypto exchange`). I'm developing this fully serverless app with `Go`.  

In this blog, I will share my latest thoughts and discoveries about my challenges, workarounds, decisions, trade-offs, and resolved problems in this project.
